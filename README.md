## Acknowledgments

Even a simple project like this can be a huge undertaking for someone who's just starting their coding journey or has only coded along to tutorials, but projects like this are a great way to build confidence and experience. I'm grateful to Frontend Mentor for hosting these projects. and [John Smilga](https://www.johnsmilga.com/) for having great tutorial content available for people like me to learn from.
